# Common API Models

This repository contains shared OpenAPI component definitions used across Polyglots services.

## Purpose
The goal of this module is to provide reusable schema components (DTOs) for consistent API design between client APIs and backend services.

## Structure
- `openapi/common-api-models.yaml` â€” OpenAPI 3.0.3 file defining common reusable schemas.

## Example usage
In another OpenAPI spec, reference these models:
```yaml
$ref: '../common-api-models/openapi/common-api-models.yaml#/components/schemas/PolyglotModel'
